                <h1>Return and Refund Policy at Wellness4U</h1>

                <p>
                  At Wellness4U, we want you to be completely satisfied with
                  your purchase. If you're not happy with your order for any
                  reason, we offer a straightforward return and refund policy to
                  ensure your peace of mind. Please review the following
                  guidelines carefully:
                </p>

                <h2>1. Returns Eligibility</h2>
                <p>
                  We accept returns for most unused and unopened products within
                  07 days of the delivery date. To be eligible for a return, the
                  item must be in its original packaging and in the same
                  condition as when you received it.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Return Process</h2>
                <p>
                  To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team
                  with your order number and details of the item(s) you wish to
                  return. We will provide you with instructions on how to
                  proceed with the return.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Return Shipping</h2>
                <p>
                  Customers are responsible for the return shipping costs unless
                  the return is due to an error on our part or a defective
                  product.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Refund Processing</h2>
                <p>
                  Once we receive your returned item, our team will inspect it
                  to ensure that it meets our return eligibility criteria. Upon
                  approval, we will process your refund to the original method
                  of payment within 5-7 business days.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Refund Amount</h2>
                <p>
                  The refund amount will be for the original purchase price of
                  the item(s) returned, minus any applicable restocking fees or
                  return shipping charges.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Restocking Fees</h2>
                <p>
                  In some cases, a restocking fee may apply to returns. This fee
                  covers the cost of processing and restocking the returned
                  item(s). The amount of the restocking fee, if applicable, will
                  be deducted from your refund.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Refunds for Promotional Items or Combo items</h2>
                <p>
                  If your purchase included a promotional item or a gift with
                  the purchase, the value of the promotional item will be
                  deducted from your refund if the promotional item is not
                  returned with the qualifying purchase in its original
                  condition.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Refunds for Combo items</h2>
                <p>
                  If your purchase included a combo offer item or a gift with
                  purchase, the value of the combo offer item will be deducted
                  from your refund if the combo offer item is not returned along
                  with the qualifying purchase in its original condition.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Exchanges</h2>
                <p>
